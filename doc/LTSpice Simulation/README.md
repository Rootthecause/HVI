## Notes for the LTSpice simulation

Download the VIPER simulation files from [here](https://www.st.com/resource/en/spice_model/viper01_ltspice.zip)
This Download includes VIPER011 to VIPER0013.

Add all .sub files to your local LTSpice library ‘Sub’ and all .asy to ‘Sym’ folders.<br>
Then open ‘HVI Simulation.asc’ (or restart if already open).<br>
If an error message with RFU02VS8S (diode) not found appears, use your own diode or the standard model (works just as well).
