Notes on 3D printing:

Although the files can be printed with either an FDM or SLA printer, I recommend SLA printing due to the much better HV insulation. I have tested that FDM parts can have tiny gaps in the print, rendering the insulation properties useless.
If FDM printing is your only option, mount the housing on a non-conductive surface or cover a conductive surface with non-conductive material (e.g. Kapton tape).

If you're relying only on the 3D-prints for isolation, you need to do isolation testing in order to get scruti approved. Better just use some Kapton tape and show the specs sheet to the scrutis. 
I've successfully shown isolation on self built hardware to scrutis twice, but lemme tell ya: If you don't come really well prepared, you might get roasted.
